# Tool Call Conversation Flow Fix

## Problem Fixed

The original error was:
```
You sent a message with the role "tool".

But "tool" messages must only appear as a direct response to a prior "assistant" message that had a tool_calls field.
```

## The Issue

The conversation flow was incorrectly structured. Tool messages were appearing without a proper preceding assistant message with tool_calls.

### ‚ùå Invalid flow (before fix)
```json
[
  { "role": "user", "content": "Give me recent events" },
  { "role": "tool", "content": "..." }   // <-- error: no assistant tool_call before this
]
```

### ‚úÖ Valid flow (after fix)
```json
[
  { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Delhi?" },
  { "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{ "id": "1", "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{ \"location\": \"Delhi\" }" }}]},
  { "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "1", "content": "{ \"temperature\": \"34¬∞C\" }" },
  { "role": "assistant", "content": "It's 34¬∞C in Delhi right now." }
]
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Proper Message Ordering**: Ensured that when tool calls are made, the assistant message with `tool_calls` is added to conversation history BEFORE any tool messages.

2. **Message Format Conversion**: Fixed the conversion of OpenAI API response objects to dictionary format for conversation history storage.

3. **Conversation History Management**: Simplified the logic using an `update_history` flag instead of complex message length calculations.

## Test Results

The fix was verified with comprehensive tests:

```
üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED! Tool call conversation flow is working correctly.

‚úÖ Test 1: Tool call conversation flow is correct!
   - 4 messages: user ‚Üí assistant (with tool_calls) ‚Üí tool ‚Üí assistant (final)
   - Proper tool_call_id matching
   - Valid conversation structure

‚úÖ Test 2: Simple conversation flow is correct!
   - 2 messages: user ‚Üí assistant
   - No tool calls, direct response
```

## Files Modified

- `mcp_client.py`: Fixed conversation flow logic in `_process_messages` method
- `test_tool_calls.py`: Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix

## Key Changes

1. **Message Structure**: All messages are now properly converted to dictionary format before being added to conversation history
2. **Tool Call Flow**: Assistant messages with tool_calls are added to history before executing tools
3. **History Management**: Simplified using `update_history` parameter instead of complex length checks

The MCP client now properly handles tool calls without violating OpenAI API conversation flow requirements.
